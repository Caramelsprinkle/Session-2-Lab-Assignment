            Hoyo! that mugshot you're seeing right above this? that's what I look like; Yeah, don't stare or squint to
            closely at it -
            you might develop the same tired look <br>  
            well anyways, I'm a freshman student at <a href="https://binus.ac.id">Binus International University</a> for
            batch '27.
            Now, what might a student like me doing in Binus you may ask? <br>
            Well, to make a long-story short, I ran into a lot of motivational issues as well as suffering the stress of
            having to live
            and manage everything alone for a while <br>
            and I was not able to adjust to the culture shock very well within a timely manner, so to here I have
            returned, and to Binus
            I have made my university. <br>
            <br>
            Let's see.. some other things about me.. I was told by my psychologist that I have a high possibility of
            having autism based
            on her observations of my behaviors and <br>
            conversations. <br>
            <br>
            onto much less "big detail" stuff about me, I mostly hang out with my online friends or listen to music when
            they're not around.
            I'm more of an indoor person than an <br>
            outdoors-y type, and I'd usually just barricade myself to my room, very rarely going outside to cook
            something up quick or get
            already-prepared food from downstairs. <br>
            Well, I'd say that that's about it for now.
