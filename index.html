                    Hoyo! that mugshot you're seeing right above this? that's what I look like; Yeah, don't stare or squint to closely at it - 
                    you might develop the same tired look <br>
                    well anyways, I'm a freshman student at <a href="https://binus.ac.id">Binus International University</a> for batch '27. 
                    Now, what might a student like me doing in Binus you may ask? <br>
                    Well, to make a long-story short, I ran into a lot of motivational issues as well as suffering the stress of having to live
                    and manage everything alone for a while <br>
                    and I was not able to adjust to the culture shock very well within a timely manner, so to here I have returned, and to Binus 
                    I have made my university. <br> 
                    <br> 
                    Let's see.. some other things about me.. I was told by my psychologist that I have a high possibility of having autism based 
                    on her observations of my behaviors and <br> 
                    conversations. <br>
                    <br>
                    onto much less "big detail" stuff about me, I mostly hang out with my online friends or listen to music when they're not around. 
                    I'm more of an indoor person than an <br>
                    outdoors-y type, and I'd usually just barricade myself to my room, very rarely going outside to cook something up quick or get
                    already-prepared food from downstairs. <br>
                    Well, I'd say that that's about it for now.
